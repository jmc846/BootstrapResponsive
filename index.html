          <h4>Family First:</h4>
          <p>
            Family First, is a popular phrase. One that has appeared in media ads, stories, books, logos, coffee mugs, etc. But what does is adage really mean. That is a great question. For me it means that 
            regrdless of situation, work, leisure, social climate, that the responsibilities of being Family orientated are never far from my mind. I understand the term "famiy" varies for everyone, but in my 
            opinion, those we call family, regardless of our genetic links, are those that we should hold neareset and dearest. For me, these people, form a large part of my motivations, additonally,
            they keep me grounded, and allow me to gain some perspective, even when things are cloudy in other aspects. For example, one of the main reasons I have chosen to shift my professonal trajectory, centers
            around those I consider Family. I have responsibilities, along with goals I would like to obtain for myself and others. In my humble opinion, if we can remain focused on these ideals, they will guide our
            decisions, and serves us well, when it comes to our professional live, leisure activities and our overall happiness.

           <h4>Professional Best:</h4>
    <p>
      
      No doubt, you've probably heard the term, putting your best foot forward. I like you, I try my best to be the ultimate professional day in and day out. However, being your professional best is a multifaceted 
      activity. First, let me say, I am aware this site is not perfect, and the perfectionist in me is bothered by this fact. However, I am working to grow my skills as a FUll STACK developer in order to bring my 
      skills up to par. Wow, now I feel better, but I digress. Professional best means not only to I bring my best self to the work environment, from a skills and knowledge perspective, but I bring a Professional
      demeanor that is pleasent, innovative, warm and curious. I have found that the best professional excel not only in their expertise, but also in their interactions and social currencies. Lastly, I have learned
      that one's professional best must be willing to change. I mean that one must be willing to evolve and grow. For example, if a new Javacript technique comes out, it would be beneficial to learn it, especially
      if this new technique can better performance. Never stop learning, and do your best are my professional words of wisdom.

    <h4> Don't Forget the Leisure:</h4>
    <p>
      
      I was told, that those who work hard should also play just as Hard. This is an adage, with which I agree. I have previously obtained positions that were particularly stressful, demanding or taxing. 
      For this reason, I have always made it a point to have a healthy balance between my professional life and my leisure activities. In the past, I have been my own worst enemy, and often succummed to 
      fatigue, exhaustion amongst other symptoms. But, not anymore!!!! I constantly make it a point to full my time (usually weekends) with a much fun as possible. If you take a look at the Porfolio secion, 
      you will notice several pictures. These pictures represent the activities, in which I frequently engage. For example, I ride ATVs, and DirtBikes. Often I incorporate my childrean as these are loads or 
      fun, and I ride alone and with other adults. Additionally, I am an aspiring FULL STACK DEVELOPER, hence the coding picture. Lastly, I am a dog owner, although this is not a picture of my dog, it is a cute
      picture a Belgian Malonis puppy, this is the next dog I plan to add to my family mix.  If I can offer a bit of advice, I'd say don't forget the leisure!!!!
